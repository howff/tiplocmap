# Demo map showing TIPLOC locations

Demo map showing TIPLOC locations is at https://howff.github.io/tiplocmap/

The repo needs a branch called `gh-pages` and then it gets deployed via https://github.com/howff/tiplocmap/deployments/github-pages

I've added an OpenRailwayMap but not sure I integrated it correctly.
Other map providers are shown here: https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/
